# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Practice 🚀

This repository contains my learnings, exercises, and kata implementations from the **Udemy course – Test-Driven Development: Build Software with Confidence**.  
The goal of this repo is to apply TDD principles, practice unit testing, and build confidence in writing clean, testable, and maintainable code.
